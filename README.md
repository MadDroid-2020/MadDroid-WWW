This file contains the output of our runtime hooking approach.  
To the best of our knowledge, many of the domains here cannot be found in known ad domain lists.   
Note that this list does not contain all the ad hosts, just the ones appeared in our experiments, since it's extracted during dynamic testing of our dataset.
